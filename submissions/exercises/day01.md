#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee has a more user-friendly interface compared to Lazada. In Shopee, you can easily find the product you're looking for right after you open their platform. They utilize the use of graphical icons for easy navigation access. Some users prefer icon-based interfaces, which can be advantageous for Shoppe.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: Both Shopee and Lazada have inconsistent layouts across different categories, which could potentially confuse users. Additionally, while both platforms advertise popular product listings and flash sale deals on their home pages, they exhibit visual discrepancies in how they inconsistently display products within each category.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: In terms of content organization, Shopee tends to have a more structured hierarchy of information, making it easier to scan and understand. Their platform utilizes color schemes and design elements effectively, enhancing the visual experience for users. On the other hand, Lazada's layout can be less structured, and its use of colors and design elements in product presentation is less leading than in Shopee. Additionally, in Lazada, the absence of commas (,) for large numbers in the number of items sold can be confusing, especially for prices in the thousands or higher, making it slightly harder for users to comprehend such information at a glance.â€¨

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Despite the different branding approaches, Shopee and Lazada effectively maintain consistency within their respective brand identities, allowing users to recognize and associate the design elements with their brands quickly.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: Both websites adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to tablets and desktops, allowing users to access their desired products conveniently.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee's thoughtful use of colors and visual elements effectively attracts and retains users by creating an engaging and visually appealing environment compared to Lazada.
